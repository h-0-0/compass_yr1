```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We first load in all the data which is stored locally, you can download the data from "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ashrae-energy-prediction/data". 
```{r}
building_metadata <- read.csv("building_metadata.csv")
test <- read.csv("test.csv")
train <- read.csv("train.csv")
weather_test <- read.csv("weather_test.csv")
weather_train <- read.csv("weather_train.csv")
```
Now we have loaded in the data we will print the first 6 rows of each dataset to see what the structure of the dataset looks like,
```{r}
head(building_metadata)
```
```{r}
head(test)
```
```{r}
head(train)
```
```{r}
head(weather_test)
```
```{r}
head(weather_train)
```
First what we will do is with the help of the tidyverse construct some visualizations for the data. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
